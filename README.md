# ANP Data Analysis

## What is it?

This repo contains some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of [ANP (Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis)](http://www.anp.gov.br/)
public data base.

Here we put together:

* Maps with Folium;
* Data visualization with matplotlib, seaborn and altair;
* Pandas handling excel files with multi-indexing included;
* Geopandas handling `shp` files.

The project is not related to our job. We do it in free times, just for fun!
